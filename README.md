This script is used to enable and disable cam2api without rebooting your phone

Tested and working on : Redmi 6 pro (sakura)

Inspired from TogoFire's Hal3/Hal1 switch . Check him out at @TogoFire

Usage:

1.get root access(obviously lol)

2.```pkg install git```

3.```git clone https://github.com/FrosT2k5/cam2api.git```

4.```cd cam2api```

5.```su -c bash install.sh```


Once this installation is complete,u can use the commands ```gcamon``` and ```gcamoff``` anytime you want

To enable cam2api, just open termux and type
```gcamon```

To disable cam2api, just open termux and type
```gcamoff```

Once again, thanks again to TogoFire for this idea ;p
